# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis & Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes road accident data (~660,000 records) to uncover insights into accident trends, severity, and contributing factors. The analysis is done using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**, and interactive dashboards are built in **Tableau** and **Excel** for visual storytelling.  

The goal is to identify **patterns in accidents** (by vehicle type, weather, road conditions, and severity) and provide **data-driven insights** that can help in improving road safety policies.

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source:** UK Road Accident Data (sample of ~660k records used).  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Key Fields:**  
  - Accident Date & Time  
  - Vehicle Type  
  - Road Type & Surface Condition  
  - Weather Condition  
  - Casualties (Fatal, Serious, Slight)  
  - Location (Latitude/Longitude)

## 🧑‍💻 Jupyter Notebook (`DAIENG.ipynb`)  
The notebook covers:  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Trend analysis (accidents by month, severity, vehicle type)  
- Insights exported for dashboards

### 📊 Excel Dashboard  
- KPI cards for total accidents, casualties, fatalities, etc.  
- Breakdown by vehicle type, road type, weather condition  
- Trendlines for accident comparison across years  
- (No map visualization, but complete numeric & categorical insights)  

📌 **Preview:**

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- 🚗 **Cars** contribute the highest number of casualties.  
- 🌧️ Most accidents occur in **fine weather** (not extreme conditions).  
- 🛣️ **Single carriageway roads** are the most accident-prone.  
- 📉 Overall casualties and accidents have shown a **declining trend** compared to previous years.

## 💡 Improvements (Future Scope)  
- Automate dashboard refresh with live data feeds  
- Integrate machine learning models for accident severity prediction  
- Add time-series forecasting for accident trends  
- Deploy dashboards on a public server for wider access
